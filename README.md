# ✨ Hi, I'm Stella! ✨

Welcome to my github profile :)  
I'm a software developer, creative problem-solver, and a silly goofy girl just trying to prove myself in tech.

## 🌸 About Me

- Art school dropout turned software engineer (creativity + logic)
- Currently a Junior at Telia Eesti, bringing the slay into digital analytics across our systems. My stats:
- <img width="929" height="229" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08478759-a81f-4426-9842-2ff707488e00" />
- Enjoy writing backend most (Java <3), but as I have like 3/4 of a design degree, I have a passion for frontend and a love-hate relationship with Javascript

## 🌸 Fun projects (some of them private)

- Built a [Bingo](https://bingo-ruby-omega.vercel.app/) to be played in our ~6h lectures to keep us alert and the lecturer happy 
- Coded [a mini Spring](https://github.com/st3lll4/mylittlespring), to understand the fundamentals better
- Currently trying to work on KardPop, a photocard trading and selling platform, but work keeps me busy, not gonna lie
